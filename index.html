        	        <h3>I'm Carolyn, sadly I don't have any exciting stories, but I'm from Toronto. I went to Regent Heights for elementary and currently go to Victoria Park.

My "talents" are socializing and remembering random information about things that I've seen/read. 

Short term goals are, passing my classes, staying involved in clubs and keeping people's interests.  Long term goals include maybe pursuing engineering one day. 

My catchphrase is, "don't save it for later when you can do it now!"</h3>
